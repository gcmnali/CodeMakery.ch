                <p class="content">Kayseri is a large industrialised city in Central Anatolia, Turkey. It is the seat of Kayseri Province. The city of Kayseri, if taken as the Kayseri Metropolitan Municipality, is composed of five urban districts: the two core districts of Kocasinan and Melikgazi, and since 2004, also Hacılar, İncesu and Talas.
                    As of 31 December 2019, the province had a population of 1,407,409 of whom 1,144,265 lived in this city's built-up area identified as four (out of five) urban districts, İncesu not being conurbated (not contiguous, having a largely non-protected buffer zone).[2] Kayseri is at the foot of the inactive volcano Mount Erciyes that reaches an altitude of 3,916 metres (12,848 feet), more than 1,500 metres over the city's mean altitude. The city is often cited in the first ranks among Turkey's Anatolian Tigers.[3]</p>

                <p class="content">Kültepe, one of the oldest cities in Asia Minor, lies 20 km away.
                    As Mazaca (Ancient Greek: Μάζακα),[6] the city served as the residence of the kings of Cappadocia. In ancient times, it was on the crossroads of the trade routes from Sinope to the Euphrates and from the Persian Royal Road that extended from Sardis to Susa during the over 200 years of Achaemenid Persian rule. In Roman times, a similar route from Ephesus to the East also crossed the city.                    
                    The city stood on a low spur on the north side of Mount Erciyes (Mount Argaeus in ancient times). Only a few traces of the ancient site survive in the old town.
                    For Roman and Byzantine eras see Caesaria (Mazaka).</p>

                <p class="content">Kayseri yağlaması is one of the traditional recipes of Kayseri, the beautiful city located in the middle of Turkey. It is famous mainly for its mantı and pastırma (Turkish beef bacon), but yağlama also has the same importance with mantı for Kayseri. Kayseri is 1 hour drive to Cappadocia, the gorgeous touristic destination famous for its mind blowing geographical formations and baloons. If you ever visit Cappadoccia you should also stop by Kayseri to taste mantı, yağlama and pastırma.
                    Yağlama is prepared with a special tortilla like bread, lavas. In some cases an easy yağlama can be made with store bought tortillas but according to me it's not the same thing. So it's better to spare some time and prepare this unbelievably delicious meal.</p>
